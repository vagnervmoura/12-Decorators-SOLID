PROJECT BASED ON:

In this exercise, you will extend the previously created accounting system by building a new `Manager` class. 
This class will implement the `assign` method, and actions such as `sale`, `purchase`, `balance`, etc., 
will be defined using decorators.

1. Extend the existing accounting system by creating a new class named `Manager`. 
   This class will be responsible for handling various accounting operations.

2. Implement an `assign` method in the `Manager` class. 
   This method should assign tasks to the appropriate operations in the accounting system.

3. Define the actions like `sale`, `purchase`, `balance`, etc., using Python decorators. 
   These decorators should provide additional functionalities to these operations.

4. Test the `Manager` class and decorators by creating instances of the `Manager` class, assigning tasks, and executing various operations like `sale`, `purchase`, `balance`, etc.

Hints:

- A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions.
- The `@` symbol is used for decorators in Python.
- You can define the decorators within the `Manager` class. If defined within the class, they should take `self` as the first argument.
- For the `assign` method, consider how tasks can be mapped to methods in your class. This might involve using a dictionary or similar data structure to map string task names to methods.
- Remember to use the `self` keyword to refer to instance variables and methods within the class.
